/* 
CSS PREFERENCE ORDER IS: (DECREASING DOWNWARDS)
1. Browser default styles
2. External or internal stylesheets (<link> or <style> in <head>)
3. Inline styles (using the style attribute or <style> tag in the document)
4. Important styles (rules using !important) 
*/
/* When a rule from an external stylesheet conflicts with a rule in a <style> tag inside the document, the decision is based on the following principles:
1. Specificity:
CSS rules with higher specificity are applied. For example:
p { color: red; } (less specific)
#content p { color: blue; } (more specific)
The more specific selector wins, regardless of whether it's in the external stylesheet or <style> tag.
2. Location (Cascade Order):
If both rules have the same specificity, the last rule defined takes precedence.
A <style> tag is usually closer to the element in the DOM than an external stylesheet, so it generally wins in case of a conflict.
3. Important Rules:
Any rule with !important overrides other conflicting rules, regardless of specificity or location. */
